        <h1>Born In San Jose. Raised In Modesto.</h1>
        <p>
            Around the age of 10, unfortunately our family had no other choice but to move to modesto due to the financial crisis we were facing.
            Adapting to a new environment, the new people, the uncertainty, and childhood confusion were amongst
            the many difficult challenges I had faced in my childhood.
           
            Although Stanislaus can be considered as a stale county all hope was not lost. Stanislaus is quite remarkable in terms of education.
            Transitioning schools was trivial from what I recall, years later, I obtained my high school diploma at a WASC Accredited school none other than
            Central Valley High School. I don't mean to toot my own horn but during these 4 years, I learned what is to be considered as some of the most highly valuable skills for today's age,
            such as extensive yet comprehensive computer literacy, mathematical, and film production education.
            My skills stem from windows proficiency, media creation tools such as photoshop and adobe premiere pro, to coding the very website you are reading this page from.
            After I graduated from high school it didn't take long for one tragedy to strike after another, but thanks to that, slowly but surely I have gathered wisdom and the patience to handle
            any other problems that may arise.
            I don't mean to throw a pity party whatsoever,
             YES! my parents just went through a messy divorce,
             YES! i've lost many partners,
             was forced to bloom early and move out of my parents house because of certain circumstances,
             but as I saw my world crumbling around me,
             I did not lose my hope, nor my relentlessness to change my life for the better.
             Whilst I was fighting to retain my grip on reality but also nurture my surroundings,
             I began to see foliage arise from what I previously perceived as rubble.
             On top of that I finally met someone who makes me extremely happy and consider as life long partner.
             This is why I am so compelled to tell my story, I want others to know that no matter the situation, for better or for worse, there is still a seed of hope,
             but it also takes humility to ask god, to give you the wisdom to turn your current situation into your kingdom!
